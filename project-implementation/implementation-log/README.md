# Implementation Log

This directory contains detailed logs for each milestone of the Meatware implementation process. Each log documents what was accomplished, challenges encountered, technical debt created, and next steps for future development.

## Purpose

The implementation logs serve as:
- A historical record of implementation decisions
- Documentation of challenges and their solutions
- Tracking of technical debt for future resolution
- Guidance for subsequent development phases

## Log Format

Each milestone log follows the naming convention `milestone-[#]-[name].md` and includes:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of what was accomplished
2. **Implementation Details**: Specific details about how components were implemented
3. **Challenges**: Difficulties encountered during implementation
4. **Technical Debt**: Compromises or shortcuts taken that should be addressed later
5. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for subsequent milestones

## Usage

Implementation logs should be:
- Created immediately after completing a milestone
- Referenced when planning subsequent milestones
- Reviewed when addressing technical debt
- Updated if additional information becomes relevant

These logs form an essential part of the Meatware knowledge base and help maintain continuity throughout the development process.
