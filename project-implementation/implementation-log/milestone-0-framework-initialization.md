# Milestone 0: Framework Initialization

## Summary

This milestone established the foundational project structure and standards for the Meatware framework. We created the essential configuration files and documentation standards that will guide all future development work. The focus was on setting up a solid foundation that enables consistent, navigable, and maintainable implementation of subsequent milestones.

## Implementation Details

### Package Configuration

- Created `package.json` with proper metadata and dependencies
- Configured the package for npm installation with appropriate scripts
- Defined package entry points and file inclusions
- Set up minimal dependencies focused on file operations and user interaction
- Specified Node.js version requirements
- Added bin configuration for CLI access

### Documentation Standards

- Created comprehensive documentation standards in `/docs/documentation-standards.md`
- Defined file format requirements using Markdown
- Established heading structure and formatting conventions
- Created guidelines for links, lists, code blocks, and other formatting elements
- Defined content guidelines for language, naming, and style
- Established directory-specific standards for different framework components
- Defined quality standards and review process

### Version Control Strategy

- Created version control strategy in `/docs/version-control-strategy.md`
- Defined branch structure and protection requirements
- Established workflows for feature development, bugfixes, releases, and hotfixes
- Created commit message standards following conventional commits
- Defined pull request process and requirements
- Established semantic versioning approach
- Created guidelines for changelog management and repository maintenance

### Metadata Format Specifications

- Created YAML frontmatter specifications in `/docs/metadata-format-specifications.md`
- Defined required and optional metadata fields
- Established category-specific metadata requirements
- Created field value standards for consistent taxonomy
- Provided guidelines for file path references
- Created example metadata blocks for different file types
- Defined validation requirements and integration with navigation

## Challenges

### Package Configuration Complexity

- Balancing minimal dependencies with required functionality
- Ensuring the package structure supports future extensibility
- Defining appropriate scripts for installation and operation
- Structuring the package for both programmatic and CLI use

**Resolution:** Focused on core dependencies only, with a clear separation between installation and runtime scripts. Created a flexible structure that can grow as needed in future milestones.

### Documentation Standards Scope

- Covering all potential documentation scenarios comprehensively
- Balancing prescriptive standards with flexibility for different content types
- Ensuring standards are practical and can be consistently applied
- Defining directory-specific standards without excessive repetition

**Resolution:** Created a hierarchical approach with general standards that apply to all documentation, supplemented by specific standards for each directory type. Used examples to clarify expectations.

### Metadata Schema Complexity

- Creating a schema flexible enough for different file types
- Balancing required fields with optional extensions
- Ensuring consistent naming and value conventions
- Designing for future extensibility without overcomplicating

**Resolution:** Separated metadata into core required fields and optional/category-specific fields. Created clear value taxonomies with defined enumeration options.

## Technical Debt

### Installation Script Implementation

- The `package.json` references a setup script (`scripts/setup.js`) that hasn't been implemented yet
- This will need to be addressed in Milestone 9 (Package Installation)
- Currently, this would cause a post-installation error if the package were installed

**Mitigation Plan:** Add a placeholder script that logs a message indicating the full installation functionality will be available in a future version. Complete implementation in Milestone 9.

### CLI Structure Placeholder

- The binary entry point (`bin/meatware.js`) is referenced but not implemented
- This will be needed for command-line usage of the framework
- Will require implementation as part of the package installation milestone

**Mitigation Plan:** Create minimal structure in Milestone 1 to establish the pattern, with full implementation in Milestone 9.

### Documentation Validation

- Validation of documentation against established standards is mentioned but not implemented
- Will require tooling for automated checking of standards compliance
- Could result in inconsistent documentation if not addressed

**Mitigation Plan:** Add validation implementation to the scope of Milestone 10 (Documentation & Examples).

## Next Steps

1. **Directory Structure Creation (M1)**
   - Implement the core directory structure following the established documentation standards
   - Create base templates for each file type with proper YAML frontmatter
   - Establish index files and README files for directories
   - Create the initial file organization as defined in the project specifications

2. **Documentation Standards Application**
   - Apply the established documentation standards to all new files
   - Ensure consistent use of YAML frontmatter following the metadata specifications
   - Implement the file naming conventions defined in the standards

3. **Template Development**
   - Create template files for each major file type
   - Implement the metadata structure in templates
   - Establish consistent structure for different documentation categories

4. **Standards Refinement**
   - Review the standards established in this milestone as they are applied
   - Note any areas where standards need clarification or extension
   - Prepare to refine standards based on practical application
