# Milestone 1: Core Directory Structure

## Summary

This milestone established the complete directory structure for the Meatware framework with initial templates, index files, and README documentation. We created a comprehensive and well-organized folder hierarchy with standardized file formats, naming conventions, and cross-referencing mechanisms. The structure provides the foundation for all subsequent milestone implementations and enables effective navigation throughout the framework.

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure

- Created primary directories at the root level:
  - `/knowledge/` - For contextual information storage
  - `/specification/` - For requirements documentation
  - `/implementation/` - For execution-focused plans
  - `/command/` - For reusable interaction patterns
  - `/context/` - For project state management
  - `/docs/` - For human-oriented documentation
  - `/config/` - For framework configuration
  - `/templates/` - For file templates
  - `/bin/` - For CLI executables
  - `/scripts/` - For installation and utility scripts

- Created subdirectories with proper structure:
  - Knowledge subdirectories: `/api`, `/architecture`, `/integrations`, `/conventions`, `/clarity`, `/changelog`
  - Implementation subdirectories: `/roadmap`
  - Command subdirectories: `/query`, `/generation`, `/validation`
  - Context subdirectories: `/maps`, `/state`, `/history`, `/cached`
  - Documentation subdirectories: `/human`, `/system`, `/quickstart`, `/best-practices`
  - Config subdirectories: `/environments`
  - Template subdirectories for each major category

### File Templates

- Created comprehensive templates for each file type:
  - Knowledge template with purpose, details, usage examples, and related components
  - Specification template with problem statement, requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
  - Implementation template with approach, task breakdown, validation strategy, and checkpoints
  - Command template with purpose, required context, prompt templates, and example usage
  - Context template with purpose, schema, content examples, and usage guidelines
  - Documentation template with clear structure, examples, and troubleshooting sections
  - Configuration templates in both JSON and YAML formats

- Each template includes:
  - Standardized YAML frontmatter following the metadata specifications
  - Consistent section structure appropriate to the file type
  - Placeholder content with clear instructions
  - Comments explaining the purpose of each section

### Navigation System

- Created index files for each directory that:
  - Provide an overview of the directory's purpose
  - List the directory contents with brief descriptions
  - Include usage guidelines
  - Link to related components
  - Reference appropriate templates

- Created README files for each major directory that:
  - Explain the directory's purpose
  - Describe the internal structure
  - Provide usage instructions
  - Document file formats
  - Link to index files and templates

- Created the master index file at the root level:
  - Serves as the central navigation point
  - Links to all main sections and components
  - Provides a high-level overview of the framework

### Documentation Standards

- Created file naming conventions document:
  - Established consistent naming patterns for all file types
  - Defined directory-specific conventions
  - Provided examples of good and bad naming practices
  - Included best practices for file organization

## Challenges

### Directory Depth Balance

- **Challenge**: Finding the right balance between a flat structure (easier to navigate) and a deeper hierarchy (better organization)
- **Resolution**: Limited hierarchy to a maximum of 3-4 levels deep, with clear organization at each level. Used index files to provide navigation aids within deeper structures.

### Template Complexity vs. Usability

- **Challenge**: Creating templates detailed enough to be useful but not so complex they become barriers to use
- **Resolution**: Balanced comprehensive structure with clear explanations and placeholders. Focused on essential sections while making extended sections optional.

### Consistent Cross-Referencing

- **Challenge**: Establishing a consistent approach to cross-referencing between different file types
- **Resolution**: Standardized on absolute paths from the repository root for all references, with a consistent link syntax documented in the file naming conventions.

### Navigation Complexity

- **Challenge**: Creating a navigation system that works for both humans and AI agents
- **Resolution**: Implemented dual-purpose navigation through both README files (human-oriented) and index files (navigation-oriented) with consistent linking patterns.

## Technical Debt

### Placeholder Directories

- **Description**: Created empty directories that will need content in future milestones
- **Reason**: Complete structure needed as foundation but content depends on later milestones
- **Impact**: Some directories will remain empty until their relevant milestone
- **Resolution**: Each directory has a README and index file explaining its purpose; content will be added in subsequent milestones

### Initial Templates Simplification

- **Description**: Some templates may need refinement as they are used in practice
- **Reason**: Created based on anticipated needs rather than real usage experience
- **Impact**: May require updates as implementation progresses
- **Resolution**: Plan to review and refine templates during Milestone 10 (Documentation & Examples) based on usage experience

### Incomplete Subdirectory Indexes

- **Description**: Created index files for top-level directories but not all subdirectories
- **Reason**: Prioritized establishing the primary navigation structure first
- **Impact**: Navigation within deeper subdirectories is less structured
- **Resolution**: Add subdirectory index files during the implementation of relevant milestones

### Missing Script Files

- **Description**: Created script directories but not the actual script files
- **Reason**: Script implementation is part of Milestone 9 (Package Installation)
- **Impact**: Structure exists but functionality is not yet implemented
- **Resolution**: Will be addressed in Milestone 9 when package installation is implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Self-Navigation System (M2)**
   - Implement navigation metadata in file headers using the YAML frontmatter structure
   - Create standard sections for prerequisites, next steps, and related files
   - Develop the master linking document
   - Implement navigation cues in file templates
   - Test navigation paths through the framework

2. **Cross-Referencing Mechanism (M3)**
   - Building on the established directory structure, implement consistent link syntax
   - Create dependency tracking system in the context directory
   - Develop reference indexes for cross-document navigation
   - Implement relationship visualization to show connections between components
   - Create bidirectional linking mechanism for related documents

3. **Templates Refinement**
   - As the navigation and cross-referencing mechanisms are implemented, refine templates to incorporate these features
   - Test templates with actual content to verify their effectiveness
   - Update templates based on feedback and practical usage

4. **Additional Documentation**
   - Consider creating additional documentation on how to effectively use the directory structure
   - Provide examples of navigating between different components
   - Document the relationship between different directory types
