- `/generation/` - Commands for generating content with AI tools
- `/validation/` - Commands for validating outputs and ensuring quality

## Usage

Command files are primarily used to:
1. Standardize interactions with AI tools
2. Create reusable patterns for common tasks
3. Ensure consistent results across different AI systems
4. Document context requirements for effective interactions
5. Provide examples and expected formats

## File Format

All command files follow a standardized format with:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Clear purpose statement
- Required context description
- Prompt template with variables
- Expected response format
- Example usage
- Error handling guidance
