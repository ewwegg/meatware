# Command Directory

## Overview

The Command directory contains reusable interaction patterns for consistent AI tool usage. These templates standardize communications with AI tools, ensuring consistent and effective interactions regardless of the specific AI system being used.

## Directory Contents

### Query Commands

- [Query Index](/command/query/index.md) - Commands for retrieving information from AI tools

### Generation Commands

- [Generation Index](/command/generation/index.md) - Commands for generating content with AI tools

### Validation Commands

- [Validation Index](/command/validation/index.md) - Commands for validating outputs and ensuring quality

## Current Commands

*No commands have been created yet. As commands are added, they will be listed here by type.*

## Usage Guidelines

Commands should:
- Have a clear, focused purpose
- Specify the required context for execution
- Include variable placeholders with clear documentation
- Define the expected response format
- Provide usage examples
- Be AI-agnostic (work with different AI systems)
- Include error handling guidance

## Templates

For creating new command files, use the template: [Command Template](/templates/command/_template.md)
