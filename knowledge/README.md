# Knowledge Directory Guide

> **Navigation**: [Home](/index.md) > Knowledge Directory Guide
>
> **Context**: This document explains the organization and purpose of the knowledge directory in the Meatware framework.

## Purpose

The Knowledge directory is the centralized repository for contextual information that AI tools and humans can consistently reference. It provides the foundation for specifications, implementations, and framework interactions by storing well-organized, accessible knowledge in a structured format.

## Directory Organization

The Knowledge directory is organized into the following subdirectories, each with a specific focus:

### `/knowledge/api/`

API documentation and reference materials. This directory contains information about APIs, endpoints, parameters, response formats, and other interface details.

**Example content**:
- API specifications
- Endpoint documentation
- Authentication mechanisms
- Request/response formats
- API usage examples

### `/knowledge/architecture/`

Architectural patterns, design decisions, and system structure documentation. This directory contains high-level information about how components fit together.

**Example content**:
- System architecture overviews
- Component relationship diagrams
- Design pattern explanations
- Architectural decision records
- System flow documentation

### `/knowledge/integrations/`

Information about integrations with external systems and services. This directory documents how the framework connects with other tools and platforms.

**Example content**:
- Integration specifications
- Third-party system details
- Connection mechanisms
- Authentication requirements
- Data exchange formats

### `/knowledge/conventions/`

Project-specific conventions, standards, and best practices. This directory establishes consistent approaches across the framework.

**Example content**:
- Coding standards
- Documentation conventions
- Naming conventions
- Design guidelines
- Process conventions

### `/knowledge/clarity/`

Questions and answers organized by topic. This directory captures understanding through structured Q&A.

**Example content**:
- Topic-specific Q&A documents
- Clarification on complex concepts
- Explanations of design decisions
- Documentation of insights
- Resolution of ambiguities

### `/knowledge/changelog/`

Decision logs and changes throughout the project. This directory maintains a history of significant decisions and changes.

**Example content**:
- Decision records with timestamps
- Change summaries
- Rationale documentation
- Impact assessments
- Historical context

## File Organization

Each knowledge subdirectory follows a consistent organization:

1. **Index file**: Each directory contains an `index.md` file that lists and categorizes its contents
2. **Template file**: Each directory contains a `_template.md` file for creating new knowledge items
3. **Knowledge files**: Individual knowledge files organized by topic
4. **README file**: Each directory contains a `README.md` file explaining its purpose and organization

## Knowledge Types

The framework uses several knowledge types, each with specific formats and purposes:

| Type | Purpose | Template |
|------|---------|----------|
| Conceptual | Explains key concepts | `/knowledge/templates/conceptual.md` |
| Reference | Provides detailed reference information | `/knowledge/templates/reference.md` |
| Guide | Provides instructional information | `/knowledge/templates/guide.md` |
| Decision | Documents a decision and its rationale | `/knowledge/templates/decision.md` |
| Clarity | Captures Q&A on a specific topic | `/knowledge/templates/clarity.md` |
| Changelog | Records a significant change | `/knowledge/templates/changelog.md` |

## Knowledge Entry Format

All knowledge entries follow a standardized format with these key sections:

1. **Metadata Header**: YAML frontmatter with navigation and identification metadata
2. **Purpose/Overview**: Clear explanation of what the knowledge represents
3. **Details**: Comprehensive information organized into logical sections
4. **Usage Examples**: Examples of how this knowledge is applied (when applicable)
5. **Related Components**: Links to related knowledge and other framework components

## Knowledge Cross-Referencing

Knowledge documents are extensively cross-referenced:
- Links to related knowledge items
- References to specifications that apply this knowledge
- Connections to implementations of concepts
- References to command patterns using this knowledge

All cross-references follow the standardized cross-referencing mechanism defined in `/docs/cross-referencing.md`.

## Knowledge Management Processes

### Creating New Knowledge

To create a new knowledge item:
1. Identify the appropriate subdirectory based on content type
2. Copy the relevant template from `/knowledge/templates/`
3. Fill in all required sections following the documentation standards
4. Add appropriate cross-references to related documents
5. Update the relevant index file to include the new item

### Updating Knowledge

When updating existing knowledge:
1. Update the YAML frontmatter with new version and date
2. Make the necessary content changes
3. Ensure cross-references remain valid
4. Consider creating a changelog entry for significant changes
5. Update any dependent documents affected by the change

### Knowledge Organization Principles

The knowledge organization follows these key principles:
1. **Clear Categorization**: Each knowledge item belongs in a specific category
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each concept should be documented in one primary location
3. **Appropriate Cross-Referencing**: Related concepts should link to each other
4. **Consistent Formatting**: All knowledge follows the same basic structure
5. **Evolving Documentation**: Knowledge evolves through the changelog system

## Usage Guidelines

- Always check for existing knowledge before creating new entries
- Use the templates provided for each knowledge type
- Keep knowledge entries focused on a single concept or topic
- Provide concrete examples where possible
- Ensure all knowledge is properly cross-referenced
- Update the changelog when making significant changes

## Knowledge Discovery

To find specific knowledge:
1. Start at the [Knowledge Index](/knowledge/index.md)
2. Navigate to the appropriate subdirectory index
3. Browse the categorized knowledge items
4. Follow cross-references to explore related knowledge
