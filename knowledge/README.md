# Knowledge Directory

## Purpose

The Knowledge directory contains organized information that AI tools can consistently reference. This serves as the foundation for specifications, implementation plans, and AI interactions.

- `/conventions/` - Custom conventions and standards
- `/clarity/` - Questions and answers organized by topic
- `/changelog/` - Decision logs and changes

## Usage

Knowledge files are primarily used to:
1. Provide context for AI tools when developing specifications

3. Capture understanding through Q&A in clarity documentation
4. Track changes and their rationales in the changelog

## File Format

All knowledge files follow a standardized format with:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Clear purpose statement
