# Changelog Directory Guide

> **Navigation**: [Knowledge Index](/knowledge/index.md) > Changelog Directory Guide
>
> **Context**: This document explains the purpose and organization of the changelog directory.

## Purpose

The Changelog directory maintains a historical record of significant changes to the Meatware framework. It documents why changes were made, what was changed, and how the changes impact the framework. This documentation helps users and developers understand the evolution of the framework and the reasoning behind important decisions.

## Directory Organization

The Changelog directory follows a simple, chronological organization:

1. **Index File**: The `index.md` file provides an overview of all changelog entries, categorized by type
2. **README File**: This file (README.md) explains the purpose and organization of the directory
3. **Template File**: The `_template.md` file serves as a template for new changelog entries
4. **Changelog Entries**: Individual files documenting specific changes, named according to the convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-summary.md`

## Changelog Entry Naming Convention

All changelog entries follow the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-summary.md
```

For example:
- `2023-09-04-changelog-system-introduction.md`
- `2023-09-05-navigation-system-implementation.md`
- `2023-09-10-api-structure-redesign.md`

This naming convention ensures that:
- Entries are sorted chronologically when listed alphabetically
- Entry names are descriptive and indicate their content
- Each entry has a unique, identifiable name

## When to Create a Changelog Entry

Create a changelog entry for:

1. **Significant Additions**: Addition of new features or components
2. **Major Modifications**: Substantial changes to existing features or components
3. **Deprecations**: When features or components are marked for removal
4. **Removals**: When features or components are removed from the framework
5. **Important Decisions**: When significant architectural or design decisions are made
6. **Breaking Changes**: Any change that breaks backward compatibility
7. **Policy Changes**: Changes to development policies or practices

Not every change requires a changelog entry. Minor changes, bug fixes, and routine updates can typically be documented through standard version control commit messages.

## How to Create a Changelog Entry

To create a new changelog entry:

1. Identify the date of the change
2. Create a three-word summary that captures the essence of the change
3. Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-summary.md`
4. Copy the contents of `_template.md` as a starting point
5. Fill in all required sections with detailed information
6. Add links to affected components
7. Update affected components to reference the changelog entry
8. Update the changelog index to include the new entry

## Content Requirements

Each changelog entry must include:

1. **Change Summary**: A clear, concise description of what changed
2. **Change Details**: A comparison of the state before and after the change
3. **Rationale**: A detailed explanation of why the change was made
4. **Impact Assessment**: How the change affects other components
5. **Migration Path**: How to migrate from previous approaches (if applicable)
6. **Related Changes**: Links to related changelog entries (if any)
7. **Approval Process**: How the change was reviewed and approved

## Using the Changelog

The changelog serves multiple purposes:

- **Historical Context**: Understanding how and why the framework evolved
- **Decision Transparency**: Making the reasoning behind decisions explicit
- **Impact Analysis**: Understanding how changes affect different components
- **Migration Guidance**: Finding migration paths for deprecated features
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining knowledge about past decisions
- **Onboarding Resource**: Helping new developers understand the framework's evolution
