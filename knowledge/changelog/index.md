# Changelog System Index

> **Navigation**: [Knowledge Index](/knowledge/index.md) > Changelog System Index
>
> **Context**: This document indexes all changelog entries and explains how the changelog system works.

## Purpose

The Changelog system records significant changes to the framework, including design decisions, feature additions, modifications, and deprecations. It provides a historical record of how the framework has evolved, why changes were made, and how they impact the overall system.

## Changelog System Overview

### Key Concepts

The Meatware changelog system follows these key principles:

1. **Timestamped Entries**: Each changelog entry is timestamped with the date of the change
2. **Descriptive Summaries**: Each entry contains a concise three-word summary of the change
3. **Detailed Rationale**: Each entry documents the reasoning behind the change
4. **Impact Assessment**: Each entry assesses the impact on other components
5. **Migration Paths**: Where applicable, entries describe how to migrate from previous approaches
6. **Bidirectional References**: Entries are linked to affected components and vice versa

### File Naming Convention

Changelog files follow a consistent naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-summary.md
```

Examples:
- `2023-09-01-initial-framework-creation.md`
- `2023-09-05-navigation-system-implementation.md`
- `2023-09-10-changelog-system-introduction.md`

This naming pattern ensures that:
- Entries are automatically sorted chronologically
- The primary purpose of each entry is immediately visible
- Files have unique, descriptive names

### Changelog Entry Structure

Each changelog entry includes:

1. **Change Summary**: Concise description of what changed
2. **Change Details**: Before and after comparison
3. **Rationale**: Explanation of why the change was made
4. **Impact Assessment**: How the change affects other components
5. **Migration Path**: How to migrate from previous approaches
6. **Related Changes**: Links to related changelog entries
7. **Approval Process**: How the change was reviewed and approved

## Changelog Categories

Changelog entries are categorized by the type of change:

### Additions

New features or components added to the framework.

**Current Entries**:

## Recent Changes

| Date | Summary | Type | Description |
|------|---------|------|-------------|
| *No changes yet* | | | |

## Creating New Changelog Entries

To create a new changelog entry:

1. Identify the date and create a three-word summary of the change
2. Create a new file using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-three-word-summary.md`
3. Use the [Changelog Template](/knowledge/templates/changelog.md) as a starting point
4. Fill in all required sections completely
5. Include links to affected components
6. Update affected components to reference the changelog entry
7. Update this index file to include the new entry

## Using the Changelog

The changelog system can be used to:

- Understand the evolution of the framework
- Track when and why specific changes were made
- Assess the impact of changes on dependent components
- Find migration paths for deprecated features
- Learn from the decision-making process behind changes
