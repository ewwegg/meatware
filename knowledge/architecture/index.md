# Architecture Knowledge Index

> **Navigation**: [Home](/index.md) > [Knowledge](/knowledge/index.md) > Architecture Knowledge Index
>
> **Context**: This document indexes all architectural knowledge in the Meatware framework.

## Overview

The Architecture knowledge category contains documentation of architectural patterns, design decisions, and system structure. This section provides high-level information about how components fit together and why they are designed the way they are.

## Documents by Subcategory

### Core Architecture

Documentation of the core architectural principles and structures of the framework.

- *No documents yet*

### Navigation System

Documentation of the navigation architecture that enables self-guidance through the framework.

- [Navigation System Architecture](/knowledge/architecture/navigation-system.md) - Architectural overview of the self-navigation system

### Cross-Referencing System

Documentation of the cross-referencing architecture that establishes relationships between documents.

- [Cross-Referencing Architecture](/knowledge/architecture/cross-referencing.md) - Architectural overview of the cross-referencing system

### Knowledge Management

Documentation of the knowledge management architecture.

## Managing Architecture Knowledge

### Creating New Architecture Documentation

To create new architecture documentation:

1. Determine the appropriate subcategory
2. Use the [Architecture Knowledge Template](/knowledge/templates/architecture.md)
3. Focus on high-level design and relationships between components
4. Include diagrams where appropriate
5. Document key design decisions and their rationale
6. Update this index with the new document

### Key Principles

- Architecture documentation should focus on "why" and "how" components work together
- Diagrams should be used to illustrate complex relationships
- Design decisions should include rationale and alternatives considered
- Architecture documentation should link to related specifications and implementations
- Core architectural patterns should be documented separately from their applications

## Related Components

- [Navigation System Specification](/specification/navigation/self-navigation-system.md) - Specification based on navigation architecture
- [Cross-Referencing Specification](/specification/navigation/cross-referencing.md) - Specification based on cross-referencing architecture
- [Framework Overview](/knowledge/architecture/framework-overview.md) - Overall framework architecture (coming soon)
