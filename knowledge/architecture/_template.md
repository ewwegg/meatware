> **Prerequisites**: [Prerequisite 1](/path/to/prerequisite1.md), [Prerequisite 2](/path/to/prerequisite2.md)
>
> **Context**: This document provides an architectural overview of [component] within the framework.

## Purpose

Clear explanation of the architectural component being described, its role in the overall system, and why it's designed the way it is.

## Prerequisites

Before reading this document, you should be familiar with:

- [Prerequisite 1](/path/to/prerequisite1.md) - Brief description of relevance
- [Prerequisite 2](/path/to/prerequisite2.md) - Brief description of relevance

## Architectural Overview

High-level overview of the architecture, including:
- Purpose and goals
