# Clarity Documentation

This directory contains structured Q&A documentation that captures questions, answers, and insights about various aspects of the Meatware framework.

## Directory Purpose

The clarity documentation system serves as:

1. **Central Knowledge Base**: A structured repository of questions and answers
2. **Understanding Capture**: Documentation of insights gained during development
3. **Decision Support**: A reference for decisions made based on shared understanding
4. **Implementation Guidance**: Context for implementation choices and approaches
5. **AI Navigation Source**: A knowledge source allowing AI tools to understand project rationale

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create Clarity Documents

Create a new clarity document when:

1. Important questions arise that require detailed answers
2. A topic needs explanation from multiple perspectives
3. Decisions are made that require documented reasoning
4. Understanding evolves on a particular topic
5. Implementation choices need to be justified and explained

### How to Structure Clarity Documents

Each clarity document follows a standardized structure:

1. **Metadata Header**: YAML frontmatter with navigation and reference information
2. **Topic Overview**: Brief introduction to the subject matter
3. **Questions and Answers**: Structured Q&A with context, answers, and insights
4. **Key Insights Summary**: Distilled important learnings
5. **Open Questions**: Unresolved questions for future exploration
6. **Decisions Informed**: Decisions influenced by this understanding
7. **Related Topics**: Links to connected documents
8. **Revision History**: Tracking of how understanding has evolved

### Integration with Other Framework Components

Clarity documentation integrates with:

- **Knowledge Management**: Part of the overall knowledge architecture
- **Cross-Referencing**: Referenced by and referencing other documents
- **Implementation Logs**: Providing context for implementation decisions
- **Specification Documents**: Informing the development of specifications

## Maintenance

The clarity documentation should be:

1. Regularly reviewed and updated as understanding evolves
2. Kept in sync with implementation decisions
3. Expanded when new questions arise
4. Refactored when topics become too large or need reorganization
