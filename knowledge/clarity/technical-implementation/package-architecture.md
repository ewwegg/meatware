> **Context**: This document captures questions, answers, and insights about the Meatware framework's package architecture and deployment approach.

## Purpose

This clarity document captures key questions and answers about the framework's package architecture to ensure consistent understanding throughout implementation. It serves as a reference for both humans and AI tools to align on how the framework is structured, packaged, and deployed.

## Topic Overview

The Meatware framework is designed to be implemented as a lightweight package that can be easily installed and used by individual developers. The package architecture encompasses the framework's structure, organization, deployment mechanism, and usage patterns.

## Questions and Answers

### Question 1: How should the package be structured and deployed?

**Context**: Understanding the package structure and deployment approach is essential for implementing the framework in a way that aligns with its goals.

**Answer**: 

The framework should be implemented as a lightweight package with the following characteristics:

- **NPM Package**: Installable via npm for easy integration into JavaScript/TypeScript projects
  
- **Directory Structure Focus**: The package consists primarily of directory structure and template files rather than complex functionality
  
- **Self-Contained**: All framework components are contained within a single root directory
  
- **Minimal Dependencies**: The framework should have minimal external dependencies to maintain simplicity
  
- **File-Based**: Functionality is implemented through file structure and content rather than code
  
- **Template-Driven**: The package includes templates for all standard file types
  
- **Documentation-Rich**: Comprehensive documentation is included within the package itself
  
- **Installation Simplicity**: Installation should be possible with a single command
  
- **Zero Configuration**: The framework should work immediately after installation without configuration

Implementation details include:

1. **Package Structure**: The package exports the directory structure and templates as its primary content
2. **Installation Process**: Installation creates the directory structure in the target project
3. **Template Files**: All template files are included and copied during installation
4. **Documentation**: Documentation files are included and installed with the package
5. **Entry Points**: The package includes entry point files (campaign.md, conquer.md) at the root level
6. **Scripts**: Minimal helper scripts may be included for common operations

**Insights Gained**:
- The package is primarily structure and content rather than code
- Simplicity of installation and usage is a priority
- The framework's value comes from its organization rather than functionality
- Documentation is an integral part of the package, not separate

**Implementation Impact**:
- Package.json should be structured for minimal dependencies
- Installation scripts should create the directory structure
- Documentation should be included in the package
- Templates should be complete and ready to use after installation

### Question 2: What are the key considerations for the package.json configuration?

**Context**: The package.json file is central to the npm package configuration and sets up how the framework is installed and used.

**Answer**: 

The package.json configuration should reflect the following key considerations:

- **Package Name**: The package should use a namespace to avoid conflicts (e.g., @meatware/framework)
  
- **Version**: Follow semantic versioning (semver) for clear communication of changes
  
- **Description**: Clear, concise description focusing on practical utility
  
- **Keywords**: Include relevant keywords for discoverability (e.g., "ai", "documentation", "framework")
  
- **Main File**: May not be critical as the package primarily provides directory structure
  
- **Scripts**:
  - Installation scripts to create directory structure
  - Basic utility scripts for common operations
  - No complex build or test scripts needed initially
  
- **Dependencies**:
  - Minimal external dependencies
  - Only include essential packages
  
- **Dev Dependencies**:
  - Development tools if needed for package maintenance
  - Documentation generation tools if used
  
- **Files**: Explicitly list directories and files to include in the package
  
- **Repository**: Link to the GitHub repository
  
- **License**: Open source license (e.g., MIT) to encourage adoption

Implementation details include:

1. **NPM Configuration**: Configure package.json for proper installation of directory structure
2. **Installation Hooks**: Use postinstall scripts if needed to set up the framework
3. **Documentation Links**: Include links to online documentation
4. **Author Information**: Include contact information for framework maintainers
5. **Contribution Guidelines**: Reference contribution process if open source

**Insights Gained**:
- Package.json configuration should prioritize simplicity
- Installation process is a key consideration
- Dependencies should be minimized
- Open source approach supports adoption goals

**Implementation Impact**:
- Package.json must be carefully configured for proper installation
- Installation scripts need to create the complete directory structure
- Templates should be packaged properly for installation
- Documentation should be accessible after installation

### Question 3: How should extensibility be considered in the package architecture?

**Context**: While the MVP focuses on simplicity, understanding the approach to extensibility helps inform architectural decisions.

**Answer**: 

For the MVP implementation, extensibility is deliberately de-prioritized in favor of optimizing for the primary use case:

- **Focused Optimization**: The framework should be perfectly optimized for its primary use case rather than planning for various extensions
  
- **Simplicity Priority**: Extensibility considerations are over-engineered for the MVP stage
  
- **Standard Over Custom**: The focus is on a standardized approach that works well for the common case
  
- **Future Adaptability**: While not building explicit extension points, the file-based nature of the framework provides natural adaptation opportunities
  
- **User Feedback Driven**: Future evolution will rely on feedback from users rather than pre-planned extension mechanisms
  
- **Organic Growth**: Allow the framework to evolve naturally based on usage patterns rather than building complex extension architecture

This approach manifests as:

1. **Standard Structure**: Focus on a well-designed standard structure without variation points
2. **Complete Templates**: Provide complete templates rather than extensible template systems
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Maintain clear separation between framework components
4. **Documentation Focus**: Document the standard approach thoroughly rather than extension options
5. **Simple Implementation**: Avoid complex mechanisms designed for future extensions

**Insights Gained**:
- Over-engineering for extensibility can complicate the MVP unnecessarily
- A well-designed standard approach provides more value initially than extension options
- The file-based nature of the framework allows natural adaptation without explicit mechanisms
- User feedback is more valuable for guiding evolution than pre-planned extension points

**Implementation Impact**:
- Implement a clean, focused standard structure without complex variation points
- Focus documentation on the standard approach rather than customization
- Avoid introducing complexity for hypothetical future extensions
- Maintain clean separation of concerns for natural evolution

## Key Insights Summary

1. **Structure Over Functionality**: The package is primarily focused on providing directory structure and templates rather than complex functionality, with the framework's value coming from its organization and documentation.

2. **Simplicity and Immediacy**: The package architecture prioritizes simplicity of installation and immediate usability, with a zero-configuration approach that works out of the box.

3. **Standard Over Extensible**: The MVP implementation focuses on a well-designed standard approach rather than extensibility, allowing the framework to evolve based on actual usage patterns and user feedback.

## Open Questions

1. What minimal scripts might provide value without adding complexity?
2. How should package versioning be managed as the framework evolves?
3. What installation validation might ensure the framework is correctly installed?

## Decisions Informed

1. [Package.json Configuration](/project-implementation/implementation-log/milestone-0-framework-initialization.md) - The understanding of package architecture informed the initial package.json setup.
2. [Directory Structure Implementation](/project-implementation/implementation-log/milestone-1-core-directory-structure.md) - Package architecture considerations influenced how the directory structure was implemented.
