# Specification Directory

## Overview

The Specification directory contains requirements documentation that establishes what needs to be built. These specifications translate knowledge into well-defined requirements with clear acceptance criteria.

## Directory Contents

Specifications are organized by feature areas, with each specification file following a standardized format:

- Problem Statement
- Requirements (using must/should/may language)
- Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria (in testable format)
- Design Decisions (including alternatives considered)
- Related Specifications

## Current Specifications

*No specifications have been created yet. As specifications are added, they will be listed here by feature area.*

## Usage Guidelines

Specifications should:
- Clearly define the problem being solved
- Use precise language to specify requirements
- Include measurable acceptance criteria
- Document design decisions and alternatives considered
- Link to related specifications and knowledge items
- Be reviewed and approved before implementation begins

## Templates

For creating new specification files, use the template: [Specification Template](/templates/specification/_template.md)
