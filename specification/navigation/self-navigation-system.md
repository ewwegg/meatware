# Self-Navigation System Specification

> **Context**: This document specifies the requirements and design for the self-navigation system and should be referenced when implementing this feature.

## Problem Statement

AI tools currently require significant human guidance to navigate through framework documentation and understand relationships between different documents. Without a standardized navigation system, AI assistants must rely on explicit human instructions, limiting their autonomy and increasing the mental load on developers. The framework needs a self-navigation system that enables AI tools to independently traverse the documentation structure, understand document relationships, and make informed decisions about which documents to reference.

## Prerequisites

Before reading this document, you should be familiar with:

- [Navigation System Architecture](/knowledge/architecture/navigation-system.md) - The architectural overview of the self-navigation system
- [Navigation Metadata](/docs/navigation-metadata.md) - The metadata structure used for navigation
- [Standard Navigation Sections](/docs/standard-navigation-sections.md) - The standardized sections for navigation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **MUST**: The system must provide a standardized metadata format in YAML frontmatter for specifying document relationships
2. **MUST**: The system must define required navigation sections for all framework documents
3. **MUST**: The system must establish consistent navigation cues at the beginning and end of each document
4. **MUST**: The system must include index files for each directory to facilitate document discovery
5. **MUST**: The system must support bidirectional navigation between related documents
6. **SHOULD**: The system should provide context hints to explain when specific documents are relevant
7. **SHOULD**: The system should support multiple navigation paths based on different use cases
8. **MAY**: The system may include visualization aids for document relationships

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **MUST**: The system must be AI-agnostic, working with any AI tool capable of reading markdown
2. **MUST**: The system must maintain backward compatibility with existing documentation formats
3. **MUST**: The system must be lightweight and not require any external tools or processing
4. **SHOULD**: The system should be intuitive enough for human developers to navigate without guidance
5. **SHOULD**: The system should scale effectively with increasing documentation size

## Constraints

- All navigation must be implemented using standard markdown and YAML
- The system must not rely on any JavaScript or other dynamic content
- Navigation metadata must not significantly increase file size or impair readability
- The system must work with any AI tool that can process markdown content
- Implementation must be compatible with all file types in the framework

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI tools can navigate from the root index to any document by following navigation links
- [ ] Each document contains complete metadata specifying its relationships to other documents
- [ ] All documents include standardized navigation sections (prerequisites, related documents, next steps)
- [ ] Navigation cues are present and consistent across all document types
- [ ] Navigation paths are bidirectional, allowing forward and backward traversal
- [ ] Directory indexes provide comprehensive listings of all contained documents
- [ ] Multiple common navigation paths have been tested and validated

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: YAML Frontmatter for Navigation Metadata

**Context**: The system needs a structured way to store navigation metadata that is both machine-readable and human-editable.

**Options Considered**:
- YAML frontmatter at the beginning of markdown files
- Separate JSON configuration files
- Special markdown syntax within the document body

**Decision**: Use YAML frontmatter because it is already a standard practice in static site generators, is easily readable by both humans and machines, and keeps metadata together with content.

### Decision 2: Standardized Navigation Sections

**Context**: The system needs consistent documentation patterns that AI tools can recognize.

**Options Considered**:
- Embedding navigation only in metadata
- Using standardized sections within the document body
- Using special comment syntax for navigation

**Decision**: Use standardized sections within the document body, specifically "Prerequisites," "Related Documents," and "Next Steps," as they provide clear, human-readable navigation cues while still being machine-parsable.

### Decision 3: Directory Index Files

**Context**: The system needs a way to discover all documents in a directory.

**Options Considered**:
- Rely on filesystem operations
- Create index files for each directory
- Use a central registry of all documents

**Decision**: Create index files for each directory that list all contained documents with descriptions, as this approach works well for both humans and AI tools without requiring filesystem access.

## Next Steps

After reading this document, you may want to explore:

- [Self-Navigation Implementation](/implementation/roadmap/milestone-2/self-navigation-system.md) - How to implement the self-navigation system
- [Cross-Referencing Specification](/specification/navigation/cross-referencing.md) - Specification for the related cross-referencing system

## Implementation Considerations

- Consider creating validation tools to ensure navigation metadata consistency
- Implement documentation generators to maintain index files automatically
- Ensure templates for all document types include the required navigation sections
- Create examples demonstrating different navigation paths through the framework
- Consider visual aids or diagrams to represent document relationships
