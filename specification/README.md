# Specification Directory

## Purpose

The Specification directory contains requirements documentation that establishes what needs to be built. These specifications translate knowledge into well-defined requirements with clear acceptance criteria.

## Structure

Specifications are organized by feature areas, with each specification file following a standardized format:
- Problem Statement
- Requirements (using must/should/may language)
- Constraints
- Acceptance Criteria (in testable format)
- Design Decisions (including alternatives considered)
- Related Specifications

## Usage

Specification files are primarily used to:
1. Document clear requirements for features and components
2. Establish measurable acceptance criteria
3. Capture design decisions and rationales
4. Define constraints and limitations
5. Serve as the foundation for implementation plans

## File Format

All specification files follow a standardized format with:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Clear problem statement
- Structured requirements
- Testable acceptance criteria
- Design decision documentation
- Links to related specifications

## Navigation

For a complete overview of this directory's contents, see the [Specification Index](index.md).

## Templates

For creating new specification files, use the [Specification Template](/templates/specification/_template.md).
