# Meatware

A framework for enhancing human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Overview

Meatware is an integrated framework that systematically manages context, plans, and interactions through a cohesive directory structure installed as a single package. The framework provides clear entry points for different development phases, guiding AI assistants through a structured workflow that reduces developer mental load.

This framework is designed for individual developers working with AI coding assistants, providing a transparent system where all context and mechanisms are visible and inspectable within the folder structure.

## Core Philosophy

Meatware is built on six essential elements:

1. **Structured Knowledge**: Organized information that AI tools can consistently reference
2. **Clear Specifications**: Well-defined requirements that establish what needs to be built
3. **Detailed Implementation Plans**: Step-by-step approaches that map out how to build it
4. **Standardized Interactions**: Consistent patterns for communicating with AI tools
5. **Contextual Awareness**: A shared understanding of the current development state
6. **Transparency**: Making all context and mechanisms visible and inspectable by users

## Key Features

- **Universal Primer**: One-command approach to prime any AI assistant with essential context
- **Dual-Phase Planning**: Separate systems for specification development and implementation planning
- **Command Registry**: System for registering, discovering, and executing common AI interaction patterns
- **Context Management**: Intelligent selection of relevant knowledge based on the current task
- **Documentation System**: Human-readable guides and references for effective meatware usage
- **Integration System**: Methods to connect meatware with various AI tools
- **Transparent Operation**: All framework mechanisms visible within the folder structure

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install meatware
```

### Entry Points

- **Documentation Phase**: Start with [campaign.md](/campaign.md) to build your documentation
- **Execution Phase**: Use [conquer.md](/conquer.md) for implementation

### Documentation
