# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Project Phase: Planning & Documentation

This project is currently in the planning and initial documentation phase. The focus is on developing a comprehensive framework plan and creating concise documentation that clearly articulates what Meatware is and how it should be implemented.

## Project Purpose

Meatware is an integrated framework enhancing human-AI collaboration in software development by systematically managing context, plans, and interactions. The system will provide clear entry points for different development phases through a cohesive directory structure installed as a single package.

## Core Philosophy

All planning and documentation must continuously align with these core concepts:

1. **Structured Knowledge**: Organized information that AI tools can consistently reference
2. **Clear Specifications**: Well-defined requirements establishing what needs to be built
3. **Detailed Implementation Plans**: Step-by-step approaches mapping out implementation
4. **Standardized Interactions**: Consistent patterns for communicating with AI tools
5. **Contextual Awareness**: Shared understanding of current development state

## Claude Collaboration Guidelines

When working in this repository, Claude should:

1. **Use Extended Thinking**: Always utilize maximum token allowance and extensive reasoning for all tasks. Cost optimization is not a concern; the focus is on producing the highest quality outcome.

2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Proactively seek information when concepts are unclear or details are missing.

3. **Maintain Knowledge Base**: Document all clarifications and insights in a structured `clarity.md` file, organized by topic with clear headers and concise points.

4. **Apply Critical Thinking**: Consistently evaluate how each planning document and specification ties back to the core philosophy and objectives.

5. **Focus on Integration**: Ensure all documentation emphasizes how components interconnect rather than treating them as isolated elements.

6. **Provide Rationale**: Include reasoning behind recommendations and design decisions.

7. **Prioritize Conciseness**: Aim for comprehensive but succinct documentation that avoids unnecessary verbosity.

## Repository Structure

The repository is being developed to include:

- **Dual Entry Points**: Documentation entry (`campaign.md`) and execution entry (`conquer.md`)
- **Directory Structure**: Knowledge, specification, implementation, command, context, docs, and config directories
- **Cross-Referenced Documentation**: Files that reference and build upon each other

## Next Steps

Focus on developing:

1. Clear architectural documentation
2. Implementation specifications
3. Templates for knowledge organization
4. Framework for AI context management
5. Integration patterns between components

All development should continuously reinforce the self-guiding nature of the system while maintaining AI-agnostic design principles.
