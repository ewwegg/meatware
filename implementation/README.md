# Implementation Directory

## Purpose

The Implementation directory contains execution-focused plans that translate specifications into working code. These plans provide step-by-step approaches for implementing features and components of the framework.

## Structure

- `/roadmap/` - Milestone-based organization
  - Each milestone has its own subdirectory
  - Features within each milestone have their own files

Implementation plans include:
- Approach overview
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- Validation strategy tied to specification criteria
- Developer checkpoints
- Links to corresponding specifications

## Usage

Implementation files are primarily used to:
1. Break down specifications into actionable tasks
2. Define clear implementation approaches
3. Establish validation strategies for features
4. Mark checkpoints for developer review
5. Track implementation status and progress

## File Format

All implementation files follow a standardized format with:
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Implementation approach
- Task breakdown
- Validation strategy
- Developer checkpoints
- Risk assessment
- Links to specifications being implemented

## Navigation

For a complete overview of this directory's contents, see the [Implementation Index](index.md).

## Templates

For creating new implementation files, use the [Implementation Template](/templates/implementation/_template.md).
