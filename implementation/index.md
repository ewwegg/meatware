# Implementation Directory

## Overview

The Implementation directory contains execution-focused plans that translate specifications into working code. These plans provide step-by-step approaches for implementing features and components of the framework.

## Directory Contents

### Roadmap

- [Roadmap Index](/implementation/roadmap/index.md) - Milestone-based organization of implementation plans

### Feature-specific Implementation Plans

Each feature implementation includes:
- Approach overview
- Task breakdown with dependencies
- Validation strategy tied to specification criteria
- Developer checkpoints
- Links to corresponding specifications

## Current Implementation Plans

*No implementation plans have been created yet. As plans are added, they will be listed here by feature area and milestone.*

## Usage Guidelines

Implementation plans should:
- Directly correspond to one or more specifications
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Include clear validation strategies that map to acceptance criteria
- Mark checkpoints for developer review
- Track implementation status and progress
- Document technical decisions made during implementation

## Templates

For creating new implementation plan files, use the template: [Implementation Template](/templates/implementation/_template.md)

## Related Components

- [Specification Directory](/specification/index.md): Provides the requirements these plans implement
- [Knowledge Directory](/knowledge/index.md): Provides context for implementation decisions
- [Context Directory](/context/index.md): Tracks implementation state and progress
