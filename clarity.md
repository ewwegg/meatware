# Clarity Document

This document captures clarifications, insights, and answers to questions about the Meatware project. It serves as a structured knowledge base that evolves as the project develops.

## Project Philosophy

### Transparency
- **Question**: How should transparency be implemented in the framework?
- **Understanding**: Transparency means that the framework operates entirely within its folder structure, making all context and mechanisms visible and inspectable by users. All information used by AI tools should be explicitly present in files that developers can read and modify.

### Implementation Focus
- **Question**: Should the project prioritize comprehensive functionality or lightweight implementation?
- **Understanding**: The project should focus on a lightweight MVP implementation suitable for an indie solo developer. Simplicity is a priority, and the focus should be on the essential core functionality rather than extensive features.

### Target Users
- **Question**: Who are the primary users for this framework?
- **Understanding**: The framework is primarily designed for individual developers, not teams or enterprises. It should serve both AI experts and developers with limited AI experience through an intuitive structure.

### Adoption Approach
- **Question**: How should users adopt and integrate the framework?
- **Understanding**: The framework should focus on "quick wins" that deliver immediate value with minimal setup. The process should be streamlined to reduce developer mental load, with the AI handling the cognitive heavy lifting.

## Technical Implementation

### Package Architecture
- **Question**: How should the package be structured and deployed?
- **Understanding**: The framework should be implemented as a lightweight package installable via npm, consisting primarily of directory structure and template files rather than complex functionality.

### Extensibility Considerations
- **Question**: Should the framework be designed with extensibility in mind?
- **Understanding**: Extensibility considerations are over-engineered for the MVP stage. The focus should be on optimizing for the primary use case rather than planning for future extensions.

### Future Integrations
- **Question**: Should the framework plan for integration with other tools and systems?
- **Understanding**: The product should be designed to be lightweight and not plan for future integrations. It should be perfectly optimized for its use case: a single folder in the root directory installable with npm.

## Project Evolution

### Commercial Considerations
- **Question**: Should commercial potential be a factor in design decisions?
- **Understanding**: Commercialization is not a priority; widespread adoption is more important. The project will not be commercialized, and design decisions should prioritize usability and adoption over commercial potential.

### Documentation Approach
- **Question**: What type of documentation should be prioritized?
- **Understanding**: Focus on pragmatic documentation that directly relates to the use of the framework. Avoid documentation that verges on marketing or showcases. Documentation should be specific, concise, targeted, and informationally dense.

### Framework Evolution
- **Question**: How will the framework adapt to evolving AI capabilities?
- **Understanding**: The simplicity of the framework is a strength, allowing new models and capabilities to use it without significant changes. Future evolution will rely on feedback from users rather than pre-planned adaptation mechanisms.

### Standardization vs. Flexibility
- **Question**: How should the framework balance standardization with flexibility?
- **Understanding**: Standardized structure is the priority. Everything essential should be covered by the standardized approach, with project-specific flexibility as a future consideration if it becomes necessary. Initially, no customization options are needed as the framework will adjust to users as they complete the documentation.

### Naming Considerations
- **Question**: Should entry point and directory names be reconsidered?
- **Understanding**: The current entry point names (`campaign.md` and `conquer.md`) are acceptable at this stage. Naming revisions are not a priority for the MVP.

## Project Specifications Development

### Specification Approach
- **Question**: When creating project specifications, what should be the focus?
- **Understanding**: The specifications should focus on every heading, subheading, and bullet point from the revised project idea. They should explain what the plan looks like to implement each item, not how to code or implement it technically. The specifications should be specific enough for an AI model to understand what to consider when implementing the framework.

### Implementation Detail Level
- **Question**: How detailed should implementation specifications be at this stage?
- **Understanding**: We're documenting the project itself, not the implementation yet. File structure examples are appropriate, but code snippets are not needed at this stage. Explanations should be specific to implementation plans but not dive into technical code-level details.

### Cross-Referencing Mechanisms
- **Question**: How should cross-referencing be handled in the specifications?
- **Understanding**: Cross-referencing mechanisms are one of the most critical features and should be carefully selected and detailed as they're crucial to the project's success. This needs special attention in the specifications.

### Challenge Identification
- **Question**: Should specifications include potential challenges?
- **Understanding**: The specifications should include both the implementation plan specifics and potential challenges or conflicts. This helps ensure the overall project will work before moving to actual implementation planning.
